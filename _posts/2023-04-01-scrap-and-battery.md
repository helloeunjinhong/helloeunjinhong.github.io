#### About the Game
Scrap and Battery is a 3D third person game where players play as a small robot, carrying a battery which is their main life source, but also a key. This game is developed through Unreal Engine 5.\
The player doesn't have an idea of HP. However, carrying the battery means they are 'using' the power of battery to move forward. When they get attacked by the enemy, it drops. While the player is not holding it, the temporary battery starts to get consumed, for not a long enough time. During this short amount of time is a chance for the player to pick up a battery again.\
To open the door that leads to the next level, the battery should have at least 1 power left to open the door. This requires the player to reach the door as fast as they can, so they have enough power to progress.


#### Work I've Done
I was the Game AI programmer, created main framework of state machines and behavior trees for various enemy AI development. This base framework is used to all types of enemies, that shares specific patterns.
- Established basic enemy AI finite-state machines and behavior trees used to all types of enemies.
- Built utility-based AI architecture for 2 types of enemies considering their unique abilities, using UE5 blueprints and behavior trees.
- Developed enemy AI interactions with player and player abilities.
- Implemented enemy animations using UE5 animation blueprints.
- Collaborated with 2 gameplay programmers, designing concept and flow of the gameplay, along with enemy designs.
- Took responsibility and guided the environment and character visuals as an art lead by finding and implementing assets.
