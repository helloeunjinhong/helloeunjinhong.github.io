### About the Game
The game is about a little toy, to protect their best friend from _nightmare energies_, which causes them dream nightmares. As the player is just a small toy, the usual objects we see everyday looks absolutely huge. The game is setted at a single world, but has three stages with their own objectives.
First stage is to protect the clock which is bothered by rubber duck toys, second is to ride a train and safely reach to the end avoiding the plane attacks, and last is to defeat the greatest _nightmare_, which is a huge toy that looks like a cat. The whole level itself have 3D platforming, therefore not only caring about attacking the nightmares, you should also watch your footstep.
