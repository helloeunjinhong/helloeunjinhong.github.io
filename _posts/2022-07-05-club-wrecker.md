### Description
**Club Wrecker** is a 2D platforming game prototype with sight detectiosn AI, implemented with Unity.This is a prototype.

### Summary

* **Engine** : Unity
* **Language** : C#
* **Team Size** : Solo Project
* **Development Period** : April 2022 - July 2022


### About the Game
This small project's focus was to develop a two level vision cones for patrolling AI, with a finite-state machine. The enemy has four types of states: *Patrol*, *Alert*, *Chase*, and *Confused*, Their state changes depending on player's location between and inside the vision cone from the enemies.
For the vision cone, it detects the collision towards the walls and platforms using ray cast hit, therefore the vision cones don't get through the walls and give the player a chance to do strategic game play (for example, find a location where their vision cone doesn't reach, and hide until their state changes to *confused*.)
